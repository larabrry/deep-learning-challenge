# deep-learning-challenge
## Overview of the analysis: 
The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. 
Using machine learning techniques and a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that were funded by Alphabet Soup, a binary classifier was created to predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.


## Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions:

Data Preprocessing:

- The variable 'IS_SUCCESSFUL', which indicates whether the money was used effectively, was the target of the model.
- The 'EIN' and 'NAME' variables were removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features.
- The rest of the variables in the dataset were the features of the model, including: application type, affiliation, use case, organization, income amount, status, special considerations, and the ask amount.

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model:
In the optimized model includes:
- neurons
- layers
- activation functions


How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?

## Summary:


 Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
